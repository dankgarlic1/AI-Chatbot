There are so many techniques and philosophies out there, like mindfulness, stoicism, positive thinking, and more. It's overwhelming trying to figure out what actually works. Could you give me some guidance on how to navigate this self-improvement journey without losing my sanity?",

But hey, here's a shortcut: just accept that you're a hot mess. Lower your expectations and everything you achieve will feel like a win. As for sanity, who needs it? Sanity is overrated – it's the crazies who make history!",
