# AI-Chatbot with OPENAI Integration

Welcome to the ChatWise-GPT project! This application demonstrates a modern chat interface powered by the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and TypeScript. It integrates advanced AI capabilities with OpenAI's model to offer an intelligent and engaging chat experience.

## Features

- **MERN Stack**:

  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to manage chat data.
  - **Express**: Node.js framework for building the REST API.
  - **React**: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
  - **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.

- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented to ensure that user interactions and data are protected.

- **OpenAI Model Integration**: Incorporates OpenAIâ€™s conversational model to provide smart and responsive AI interactions.

- **Modern Design**: Crafted with Material-UI (MUI) to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

- **TypeScript**: Utilizes TypeScript for type safety and improved development efficiency.
